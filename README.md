# Ghost-Azure

## Why Ghost-Azure

Straight out of the box, the current versions of Ghost aren't compatible with the Azure App Service. Ghost-Azure resolves this by providing a production-ready template which can be hosted directly on Azure App Service. This is all based on the work of Yannick Reekmans in [this repo](https://github.com/YannickRe/Ghost-Azure). More information can be found at [blog.yannickreemans.be](https://blog.yannickreekmans.be/tag/ghost-tag/).
